            <h3>About my cat and his many names...</h3>
            <p id="kitty-descrip" class="mt-4">
            My cat's name is Solaire after the characcter Solaire of Astora from the game Dark Souls. Solaire was addressed by his given name for couple months after he found his forever home,
            however began to aquire nicknames. His first one was Buddy, as he is my little buddy, and it was a go to when I called for him. A couple more early nicknames he had picked up was Noodle and Wumpus.
            Noodle and Wumpus are because he has such a floppy nature when he shows affection like a noodle, and he "wumps" himself into your leg, the furniture, and his favorite, the ground.
            </p>
            <p>
                Solaire had quite the line up of nicknames and we started to put little twists on them such as Noodle Boy. These little twists turned into coming up with the most ridiculous and cute names possible for Little Floofer.
                So much so, that I created this name generator for him with the intention of sticking to a single name per day (who doesn't like calling their cat something stupid and cute).
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether you need to name your new fur baby, want a goofy nickname for them, or want piss off your significant other with a ridiculous pet name, please enjoy!
